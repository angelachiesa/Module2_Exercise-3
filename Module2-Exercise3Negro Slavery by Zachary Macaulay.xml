<p> to be compelled to daily labour for another ? Is the 
sound of the whip so very exhilarating that it dispels 
at once indolence and suffering I But I admit the fact 
of their indolence. The human mind fits itself to its 
situation, and to tbe demands which are made upon its 
energies. <interp key="this claim is not true because that is extremly racist" n="Macaulay, 8" cert="unknown" ref="https://http://www.recoveredhistories.org/pamphlet1.php?catid=66l"> </interp>
Cut off hope for the future and freedom for 
the present; superadd a due pressure of bodily suffering 
and personal degradation; and you have a slave, who, 
of whatever zone, nation, or complexion, will be, what 
the poor African is, torpid, debased, and lowered be- 
neath the standard of humanity. 

<p> " To inquire if, so circumstanced, be is happy, would 
be a question idly ridiculous, except that the affirmative 
is not only gravely maintained, but constitutes an es-

Negro's constitution which enables him to convert 
natural effects into their contraries, and so despise con-

stoics; but the fact would no more justify bis oppressors, 
than did the stubborn endurance of Epictetus the bar-

credit for the patience with which it is supported: but
